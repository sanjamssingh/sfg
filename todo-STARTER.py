TODO:
1. Draw out your app on paper! Choose a colourscheme and your widget arrangement.
2. Set up your window and create your frames. (under class definitions)
3. Fill out the Classes, following the commented instructions

    Classes and other outlines are just suggestions! If you find it more complicated
    to follow this structure than make your own - go ahead and make your own or change
    the classes here!

4. Configure rows and columns (under frame and label creation)
5. Modify layout to make it look nice!
6. Test it out!
    - Ensure that progress bar resizes with window
    - Ensure that progress bar is accurate (should be 2/3 full if there are 3 items, 2 checked off)
7. Clean up your code! Check to make sure all your instance variables are actually necessary, etc.

EXTRAS THAT WILL BE HELPFUL:

root.winfo_width() <- returns current width of the window
[Canvas].winfo_width() <- returns current width of chosen Canvas
winfo_height() will do the same for current height

        '''
        An additional method could be useful for updating the progress bar
        when a new item is added or an item is checked/unchecked.

        This method can also handle the resizing necessary when the window
        changes size, or you can handle that seperately.

class ListItem():
    '''
    Items of this class are the entire line in your To-Do List.
    They contain the Entry (for the user to type their list item),
    the Checkbutton (created once Entry is destroyed),
    and can contain your Trashcan Button if you choose to make one.
